I have separted my whole code into 6 files. Each file is 1 stage/step of the algorithm.

Files are divided into the following steps:
Step 1: Data Cleaning
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Using Imbalancing Dataset
Step 3: Classification without Feature Selection 
Step 4: Feature Selection and Classification
# Using Balanced Dataset
Step 5: Classification without Feature Selection Using Balancing Technique
Step 6: Feature Selection and Classification Using Balancing Technique

I have used the same file names as the steps name stated above.
